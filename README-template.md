## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

The first thing for this project and this is something i have thought about for a while now is the calc() property! I feel like adding that will reduce the amount of code and make it more affective, Then adding media queries. 


To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
h1 {
  font-size:calc(3vw - 3px);
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own learnings.**

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own plans for continued development.**

### Useful resources

- [code-boost](https://www.code-boost.com/beginners-guide-to-scss/) - So I have worked with scss but nothing major I think I've came a long way since then , it just clicked for me this is the article that made the most sense and was actually useful! I'm so glade my code is cleaner now. SCSS is simple and easy to use and I'd recommend anyone to use it :) definetly checkout the link if your looking to get started with scss.


- [kevin powell]() - I'll link his youtube channel but I recommend looking at it and taking some of his courses

- [Example resource ](https://www.positioniseverything.net/css-border-gradient) - couldn't figure out how to get the linear-gradent to work I do remember slice but I had to do some research again. Now it works !

## Acknowledgments

I think Kevin powell has really been a big help, I took his responsive course and it really helped me to do things better! He has made css fun I loveee it so much I'm really hoping get more into javascript to the point that is is just as fun as css. I do recommend his his youtube channel and any of his courses I will be taking more of them soon.
